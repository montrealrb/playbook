# Meetup checklist

Copy-paste the following in Github Issues to keep track of the tasks and distribute them.

## ASAP list

```
- [ ] Book the venue
- [ ] Find one or two talks

```

```
- [ ] Send alcohol licence form (if we serve alcohol)
- [ ] Publish the event on the website
- [ ] Send it to the mailing list
- [ ] Tweet about the meetup
```

## The week before the event

```
- [ ] Tell Benelux an estimate on the number of people present
- [ ] Check with the speakers if they need anything
- [ ] Check with the sponsors if they'd like to make an announcement
```

## The day of the event

```
- [ ] Order the food
- [ ] Buy the drinks
- [ ] Have a successful meetup.
```

## Things important to have on the website's announcement

I know most of the items on the checklist are mandatory in our new Rails app. But I had to have that list with wordpress

```
- [ ] Date and time
- [ ] Location name and address
- [ ] Intro
- [ ] Name of the speaker
- [ ] Title and description
- [ ] Price (i know it's free but new people don't)
- [ ] Sponsor name, logo and description
```
